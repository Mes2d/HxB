Before anything i want to say Buster is a basic tool that can be used to extract strings from hexadecimal data. It is currently limited in its capabilities, but it will be updated in the future to include more features.
# Featuresâš¡:
- The ability to dump strings from hexadecimal data ðŸ‘œ
- The ability to read and write data in hexadecimal format ðŸ“–
- The ability to detect DES-encrypted data ðŸ”’
# How it works âš™ ?
Hex Buster uses a simple algorithm to dump strings from hexadecimal data. The algorithm works by taking a hexadecimal string and then converting it into a plaintext message. The plaintext message can then be displayed to the user, the tool also has the ability to read and write data in hexadecimal format. This format is a way of representing data as a series of hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal digits are numbers from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F. The tool can read and write data in this format, which can be useful for debugging or for transferring data between different systems, finally the tool can detect DES-encrypted data. This is useful for identifying data that has been encrypted using the DES algorithm. The tool can do this by looking for the characteristic patterns that are present in DES-encrypted data
